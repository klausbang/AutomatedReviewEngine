# 🔧 Quick Fix Applied - Test Your Upload

## ✅ **Issue Fixed**

I've applied a fix to the document upload functionality:

### **What was wrong:**
- Complex component imports were failing
- Legacy upload interface had syntax errors
- Error handling was incomplete

### **What's fixed:**
- Simplified upload interface that works reliably
- Better error messages and debugging info
- Proper fallback when advanced components aren't available

## 🚀 **Test the Fix**

1. **Restart the app** if it's currently running:
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop
   - Run `start_app.bat` again

2. **Navigate to Upload Documents**:
   - Click "📤 Upload Documents" in the sidebar
   - You should now see a working file uploader

3. **Test uploading**:
   - Try uploading a PDF or Word document
   - The interface should work without errors

## 🔍 **What You Should See**

✅ **Success indicators:**
- "Using simplified upload interface" message
- File uploader appears properly
- File information displays when you upload
- "Add to Review Queue" button works

❌ **If you still see errors:**
- Look for detailed error information in an expandable section
- Check the terminal/PowerShell window for error details
- Take note of the specific error message

## 📋 **For UAT Testing**

Once the upload works:
1. **Upload test documents** (PDF or Word files)
2. **Add them to review queue**
3. **Continue with your UAT checklist** from Phase 1
4. **Document any remaining issues** for further fixes

**The core upload functionality should now work for your Version 1.0.0 testing!**
