## Project Development Prompts Log

This section logs all prompts given during the development of this project.

### Prompt 1 - Initial File Creation (July 21, 2025)
**Request:** "Save all my prompts in prompts.md."

### Prompt 2 - Project Planning and Development (July 21, 2025)
**Request:** 
```
Please also log all my prompts given by me in this project, so that I have a log of the prompts given to make this project.

You are an experienced software developer and software development project manager and software architect.

I need your help to plan the development of a software development project, including performing the development.

I am the product owner, so if you are in doubt of anything regarding the functionality of the program, please ask me for directions, but you are always welcome to provide proposals that I can choose from.

Please make the plan for the project (no time estimates - just the tasks and subtasks).
Make the plan in a markdown document and make also a gantt chart of the project plan.
Keep track of the progress in a progress.md file, including date and time used for the individual tasks and subtasks.

### Prompt 3 - Requirements Clarification and MVP Definition (July 21, 2025)
**Request:**
```
First read "prelimiminary requirements.md"

Let me answer your questions:
1) , 2)  See "prelimiminary requirements.md"
3) Let us start with a flow based scripted review and wait with introducing AI until it is needed or beneficial and safe.
4) For the first release local using Streamlit UI.
5) Let us make a lightweight MVP where a document can be reviewed with a few content elements and reported in the review report.

**Summary of Phase 2.1 Implementation:**
This prompt initiated Phase 2.1 (Document Processing Foundation) which included:

1. **PDF Processor (pdf_processor.py)** - Comprehensive PDF document processing with:
   - Dual-engine text extraction (PyPDF2 + pdfplumber)
   - Metadata extraction with fallback handling
   - Document structure analysis
   - Image extraction capabilities
   - Robust error handling and validation
   
2. **Word Processor (word_processor.py)** - Complete Word document handling with:
   - Text content extraction from paragraphs, tables, headers/footers
   - Document structure analysis (headings, lists, tables)
   - Metadata extraction (core properties, custom properties)
   - Image extraction with positioning information
   - Style and formatting analysis
   
3. **Document Validator (document_validator.py)** - Unified validation framework with:
   - File existence and format validation
   - Security checks (file size, malware scanning)
   - Content completeness analysis
   - Regulatory compliance checking (EU Declaration of Conformity)
   - Language detection and content validation
   
4. **File Manager (file_manager.py)** - Complete file upload and management system with:

   - Configurable analysis options
   - Batch processing capabilities
   - Result aggregation and reporting
   - Export functionality (JSON, CSV)
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging
   
6. **Comprehensive Test Suite (test_document_processing.py)** - Complete test coverage with:
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration testing
   - Edge case handling
   - Error condition testing
   - Memory management validation
   - Unicode and concurrent access testing

**Technical Achievements:**
