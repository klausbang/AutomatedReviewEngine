## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### **Performance Monitoring Architecture:**
```python
# Component Caching
@st.cache_resource
def get_cached_component(component_type: str):
    # Returns cached component instances

# Performance Decoration
@performance_monitor
def method_with_timing():
    # Automatic performance tracking

# Memory Management
def _manage_cache_lifecycle(self):
    # Periodic cache cleanup
```

### **Optimization Features:**
1. **Component Caching:** Reduces component initialization overhead
2. **Lazy Loading:** Components initialized only when needed
3. **Performance Tracking:** Real-time metrics collection
4. **Memory Management:** Automatic cleanup and optimization
5. **Cache Lifecycle:** Intelligent cache management
