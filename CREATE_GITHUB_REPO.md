## 📋 **STEP 2: Connect and Push Your Code**

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you instructions. Use these commands in PowerShell:

```powershell
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "c:\Users\AU000NK6\OneDrive - WSA\Documents\Python\AutomatedReviewEngine"

# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/klausbang/AutomatedReviewEngine.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin master

# Push the version tag
git push origin --tags
```

## 📋 **STEP 3: Verify Upload**

1. **Check Repository:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/klausbang/AutomatedReviewEngine
   - Verify all files are present
   - Check that README.md displays properly

2. **Check Version Tag:**
   - Click "Releases" tab
   - Should show "v1.0.0" tag

3. **Verify Structure:**
   ```
   AutomatedReviewEngine/
   ├── README.md (should display project info)
   ├── VERSION.md 
   ├── app.py
   ├── docs/ (documentation folder)
   ├── components/ (all your code)
   └── VERSION_1_0_ARCHIVE_COMPLETE.md
   ```

## 🎯 **Expected Repository URL**

Once created, your repository will be available at:
**https://github.com/klausbang/AutomatedReviewEngine**

---

## 🆘 **If You Need Help**

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Authentication Issues:**
   - GitHub may ask for username/password
   - Use your GitHub username: klausbang
   - For password, you may need a Personal Access Token

2. **Repository Already Exists:**
   - If name is taken, try: AutomatedReviewEngine-v1 or AutomatedReviewEngine-2025

3. **Push Errors:**
   - Make sure you didn't initialize with README
   - Try: `git push origin master --force` (only if needed)

## ✅ **Success Indicators**

- ✅ Repository visible at GitHub URL
- ✅ README.md displays project information  
- ✅ All 8,000+ lines of code uploaded
- ✅ Version tag v1.0.0 appears in releases
